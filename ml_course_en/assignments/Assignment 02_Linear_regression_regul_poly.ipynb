    "## General Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing the practical work, you need download the dataset accordingly to the option on your machine (or cloud service)\n",
    "1. Write a program that splits the original sample into a training set and a test set (training set, validation set, test set) with train_test_split method of Skikit Learn library\n",
    "2. Using the scikit-learn library (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), train the linear regression model for the training sample (example: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-linear-model-plot-ols-py)\n",
    "3. Check the accuracy of the model from the test set with r2_score\n",
    "4. Build a model using a polynomial function (example: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-underfitting-overfitting-py). Build plots with the dependence of the accuracy (r2_score) on the degree of the polynomial function for training set and test set (validation curve).\n",
    "5. Build a model using regularization (example: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html). select one from Lasso or Ridge. On the basis of experiments, select parameters for regularization. Build plots with the dependence of the error (r2_score) on the regularization coefficient for train dataset and test dataset (validation curve).\n",
